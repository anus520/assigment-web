            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the

                regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages

                settings.
